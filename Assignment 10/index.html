    <h2>Style Sheets + Choosing an Interactive</h2>

<p> For my thesis at DSI, I am working with the Indian organization <a href="http://www.springhealth.co.in/"> Spring Health</a>. Their main aim goal and purpose is to provide clean drinking water to rural communities without access to clean freshwater.</p>

<h3>I have 3 visualiations that I want to create</h3>

<li>
  <h4>Bullet Graph</h4>
  <p>With this visualization, I will be able to pack in more context about the story I want to tell. With a dataset of 78 people, I will break down how many of these families have kids, how much water do these familes buy, and how many of these families run out of water by the end of the day.</p>
  <p> Tools I will use-  <a href="https://www.amcharts.com/demos/bullet-chart/l"> amcharts </a> using jsfiddle
  </li>
<li>
  <h4>Network Diagram</h4>
  <p> I want to show communication between these 78 families. I have data about what influences each of these families to buy clean water. All these relationships can be highlighted using a network diagram.</p>
  <p> Tools I will use-  <a href="http://www.datavizcatalogue.com/methods/non_ribbon_chord_diagram.html"> Non ribbon chord diagram </a>
  </li>
<li>
  <h4> Area Graph</h4>
    <p> Here I will show the number of people who bought clean water over the course of a year. I know that the data shows that the number gradually increases over the year. Maybe I can convert this into a stacked area graph to compare buying patterns in 2 different villages.</p>
    <p> Tools I will use- <a href="http://www.onlinecharttool.com/graph?selected_graph=area" >this website </a> makes it easy to create area graph visuals.
